  ## Description
  ---
  In this project I've updated my personal portfolio with recent projects, bootstrapped css, and a refreshed resume. I'm loving the improvements.

  ## Installation
  ---
  No installation, just hire me.

  ## Tests
  ---
  None.

  ## Usage
  ---
  This should be used by employers to see how magnificent a candidate I am and how I enjoy tongue in cheek, hyperbolic humor.
